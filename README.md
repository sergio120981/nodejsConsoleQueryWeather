# queryWeather

This console app was made to query two API service:
from https://openweathermap.org/ and https://www.mapbox.com/

This app allows to search cities or regions with Mapbox, after that
one must select an option and the weather information is loaded 
from OpenWeatherMap.

It is mandatory to provide the API Tokens from both services
and declare then in the .env file (previously example.env, must rename it).
